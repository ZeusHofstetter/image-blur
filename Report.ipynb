    "With the invention of digital photography the process of taking and processing holiday pictures has drastically changed. With analog photography the number of pictures per film role was limited to around 30, leading to only 100-200 pictures per holiday, and consequently each picture was taken with great care and precission.\n",
    "Now, the memory of a digital camera can hold many thousands of images and the quality of the pictures can be evaluated at a later point. This has lead to a steep increase of the number of pictures per holiday but also to a decrease in the average picture quality, as less care has to be taken during the photography process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this simultaneous increase in picture quantity together with a decrease in average picture quality the post-processing steps in the photography process have become much more important. For amateur photographs, such as us, this is illustrated through the Xmas-calendar problem. \n",
    "The Xmas-calendar problem typically manifests in the last weeks befor Christmas, when the thousands of holiday pictures of the last year have to be assesed. In a first step the pictures have to be sorted in usable and unusable images, where unusable images are mainly classified as being blurry, out of focuss or obscured by an unwanted object, such as the typical finger in front of the lense. In a second more demanding step the usable images have to be sorted according to photographic quality, in order to find to 12-20 best pictures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we develop and test a machine learning (ML) method in order to automatize these two picture quality assesment tasks. In a first step we use the CERTH Image Blur Dataset [1] to develope and test the performance of different ML methods to classify blurred and out of focuss images. Next, the top XX performing ML methods are tested on a personal dataset of blurred and non-blurred pictures, to determine the transferability of the chosen approach. If the chosen ML approach is indeed transferable, we will extend the CERTH Image Blur Dataset [1] with the personal dataset of blurred and non-blurred pictures, as well as a personal data set of obstructed images. We will then train and test the ML methods on this extended data-set to correctly classify the pictures as usable or unusable. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an extention to this work, or if we finish the first part soon enoughf, we propose to extend the ML approach, either by retraining the first ML classifieror by training a second ML classifier, to also sort the usable images based on photography quality. \n",
